# Signal Reflection
## Short Definition
(From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflections_of_signals_on_conducting_lines#:~:text=A%20signal%20travelling%20along%20an,terminated%20in%20its%20characteristic%20impedance.)) -> A signal travelling along an electrical [transmission line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_line "Transmission line") will be partly, or wholly, [reflected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)") back in the opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a [discontinuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuity_(mathematics) "Discontinuity (mathematics)") in the [[characteristicImpedance]] of the line, or if the far end of the line is not [terminated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_termination "Electrical termination") in its characteristic impedance.

## Mathematics Basics
The reflection coefficient is calculated as follows :
$$
\begin{flalign}
\Gamma &=  \frac{Z_L-Z_0}{Z_L+Z_0} &
\end{flalign}
$$
Then, the reflected signal can be calculated as follows :
$$
\begin{flalign}
V_r &= V_i \cdot \frac{Z_L-Z0}{Z_L+Z_0} &
\end{flalign}
$$
