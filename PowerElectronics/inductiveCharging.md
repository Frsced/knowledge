# Inductive Charging
## Short Definition
(From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging)) -> Inductive charging is a type of wireless power transfer which uses electromagnetic induction to provide electricity to portable devices. 

## Concept
### Power Transmission
The concept of inductive chaging is presented in the figure below :

### Transmission Distance
The distance between the charging and portable station can differ in the application. In order to increase the distance between devices, the ["resonant inductive coupling"](resonsantInductiveCoupling)  shall be used.
